Thus: a simple GUI which works around a project.

Project is a directory with:
  - data file (.CSV)
  - settings file (bright.xml)
     Description
     Learner settings
     Location of data file
  - current best network (.str)
  - working files (.vd, .idt, inference files)
  
Operations:

Global: create new project
        global settings (path to bright-home)

In project:
  - Modify settings
    + includes loading a data file
      -> provides feed-back when loading a data file:
         list of attributes
         number of instances
         missing data ?
  - Start/stop learner
    While running: update best solution, get ETA
  - Visualize current best network (weights.dot.ps)
